| `info`	    | Get the current version of the Database and compare to the file path	                                                                                                                                       |
| `undo`     | Undo to a specific version or until a sepecific version	                                                                                                                                                                                    |


### Flags and Parameters

* `--connection-string` - The connection string 
* `--path` - The path for the migration files
* `--dry-run` - Dry run mode, do not run the migrations (run them without commit)
* `--verbose` - More logging

## How does it work?

The uses a table called `schema_history`. If the table does not exists it will create it upon the first migration.
The table contains all migrations that were executed.
